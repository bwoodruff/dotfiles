#   Dotfiles Bootstrap

_Disclaimer: This repo is public primarily for convenience. It allows the bootstrap process to run without requiring prior authentication (for example, installing 1Password or configuring `gh` first)._

A cross-platform bootstrap script for bringing up a fresh machine with:

- shell + terminal setup
- developer tooling
- dotfiles symlinks
- macOS preferences
- applications (Alacritty, GitHub Desktop, 1Password, etc.)

Goals:

- **idempotent** (safe to re-run)
- **resilient** (keeps going when individual steps fail)
- **verifiable** (checks results after each action)
- **readable** (clear tagged output with a persistent progress bar)

---

## ━━ Quick Start

On macOS, grant your terminal app **Full Disk Access** before running the script:

_System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access_

This is required for some settings writes, including Safari preferences.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bwoodruff/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

On the first run, if your `git` `origin` is behind the remote (same branch) and a fast-forward is possible, the script fetches, pulls, and **restarts itself once** so the rest of the run uses the current repo contents (including any updated `lib/*.sh` files). Use `--no-auto-update` to skip that.

---

## ━━ What It Does

The bootstrap script runs in phases for setup, tooling, configuration, and validation.

### Core Features

- Installs and updates packages via Homebrew (macOS) or the system package manager (Linux)
- Installs apps like:
  - Alacritty
  - GitHub CLI (`gh`)
  - GitHub Desktop
  - 1Password
  - GPG
- Sets up:
  - `.zshrc`, `.vimrc`, tmux config, etc.
  - Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k
- Applies macOS preferences through a declarative defaults engine
- Applies Finder preferences through the same validation model
- Installs fonts
- Verifies outcomes after each step
- Automatically clears macOS quarantine attributes for downloaded binaries when appropriate
- Supports scheduled maintenance runs

---

## ━━ Script Behavior

### Idempotent

You can safely run the script repeatedly:

```bash
./install.sh
./install.sh --pull-dotfiles
./install.sh --scheduled
```

Nothing should be duplicated or broken on re-run. The script checks current state first and only changes what needs changing.

### Self-update

By default, the bootstrap compares your checked-out branch to `origin` (no version tags or releases: it uses `git` commits on the current branch). If you are **behind** the remote, the working tree is **clean**, and a **fast-forward** is possible, it runs `git pull --ff-only` and **re-executes** `install.sh` with the same arguments so loaded shell code matches the tree on disk. The second run will not pull again in a loop.

Self-update is skipped when it would be unsafe or ambiguous, including: dry-run mode, a dirty working tree, local commits not on the remote, pull or fetch errors, a detached `HEAD`, and when `origin` is not a clone of this repo (unless you allow it; see the table below). The install script and `DOTFILES_DIR` are expected to point at the same repository.

`--pull-dotfiles` (for example in scheduled mode) still runs a pull during the **Git** task, but the **default self-update** runs earlier. If a self-update already pulled, the later pull is skipped as redundant.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `DOTFILES_AUTO_UPDATE` | `1` | Set to `0` to never fetch/restart for updates (same as `--no-auto-update`) |
| `DOTFILES_UPSTREAM_GITHUB` | `bwoodruff/dotfiles` | Expected `org/repo` for `origin` (after normalizing `https` / `git@` URLs) |
| `DOTFILES_SELF_UPDATE_ANY_ORIGIN` | `0` | Set to `1` to run self-update even when `origin` is not that GitHub path (for example a fork) |

---

### Trust But Verify

Actions are validated where practical:

- install → check binary or app exists
- symlink → verify correct target
- defaults write → read back and verify expected value
- permissions/xattrs → re-check resulting state

Failures are logged, and execution continues when safe.

---

### Logging

Logs are written to:

```text
~/.local/state/dotfiles/install.log
```

Logging behavior:

- timestamped entries
- structured output
- command output grouped under the relevant action
- log retention
- clear end-of-run summary counters

---

### Visual Output

- sectioned output
- clean `[INFO] [RUN] [OK] [WARN] [FAIL] [SKIP]` tags
- persistent progress bar
- optional `fastfetch` block near the end
- readable spacing and grouping

---

### Next Steps

The script may print a **Next steps** section at the end of the run.

- Only shown when manual follow-up is required
- Organized by tool (for example GitHub CLI, 1Password, or GPG)
- Each subsection appears only when relevant

This keeps output concise while still surfacing manual follow-up.

---

## ━━ Flags

```bash
./install.sh [options]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force-brew` | Install configured Homebrew formulas even if the command already exists |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would happen without making changes |
| `--quiet` | Reduce terminal output |
| `--scheduled` | Non-interactive maintenance mode; implies `--pull-dotfiles` and skips prompts/runtime reloads |
| `--pull-dotfiles` | Run `git pull --ff-only` in `~/dotfiles` before applying changes |
| `--no-auto-update` | Do not fetch / fast-forward / re-exec at startup (see [Self-update](#self-update)) |
| `--strict-optional-configs` | Treat missing optional config sources as warnings |
| `--no-schedule` | Do not create/check the weekly scheduled run |
| `--no-upgrade` | Skip package-manager update/upgrade step |
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help |

---

## ━━ Platform Behavior Matrix

Quick reference for what runs where:

- **Runs on both macOS and Linux**
  - package checks and upgrades
  - symlink/config setup
  - git / dotfiles update flow (default [self-update](#self-update) at startup, optional `--pull-dotfiles` in the Git task)
  - fonts, vim, tmux, GPG, 1Password, scheduling, fastfetch
- **macOS-only**
  - Homebrew bootstrap task
  - GitHub Desktop install
  - declarative macOS/Finder preferences
  - launchd scheduler path
- **Linux-only**
  - Linux package-manager install paths (`apt` / `dnf` / `pacman`)
  - cron scheduler path
- **Interactive-only behaviors**
  - prompt-driven hostname setup
  - macOS preference task execution
  - live progress UI

---

## ━━ Safety And Side Effects

Operational notes to know before running:

- **Privilege use**
  - some install and system-level operations use `sudo`
  - the script caches sudo credentials when required
- **Restarts and reloads**
  - Finder may be restarted if Finder preferences changed
  - tmux config reload is skipped in scheduled mode
- **Scheduled mode behavior**
  - `--scheduled` implies `--pull-dotfiles` and quiet/non-interactive behavior
  - prompt-driven actions are skipped
- **Network and git**
  - unless `--no-auto-update` or `DOTFILES_AUTO_UPDATE=0`, the script may contact `git` `origin` once at the start; it does not send telemetry beyond normal `git` operations
- **Write locations**
  - updates files under your dotfiles targets and writes logs to `~/.local/state/dotfiles/`
  - can modify package-manager state and installed applications

## ━━ Project Structure

```text
.
├── install.sh
└── lib/
    ├── core.sh        # logging, UI, progress bar, task runner, shared helpers
    ├── packages.sh    # package managers + package install/upgrade logic
    ├── config.sh      # symlinks, dotfiles self-update, fonts, vim, tmux
    ├── apps.sh        # app installs (Alacritty, GitHub Desktop, 1Password, fastfetch, etc.)
    ├── macos.sh       # macOS defaults, Finder prefs, hostname handling
    └── scheduling.sh  # launchd / cron setup
```

Each module is intentionally scoped to keep maintenance manageable and avoid one monolithic shell script.

---

## ━━ Task Runner

The bootstrap flow is driven by a task list in `install.sh`.

Each task defines:

- section name
- function(s) to run (comma-separated for multi-step sections)
- platform scope
- whether interactivity is required

This keeps the top-level flow easy to read and easy to change.

---

## ━━ Function Naming Conventions

To keep shell code readable and avoid over-verbose helper names, functions follow a simple verb-first pattern:

- `is_*` / `has_*` for predicates that return success/failure
- `get_*` for value retrieval
- `print_*` for user-facing output
- `ensure_*` for idempotent "make sure this state exists"
- `install_*`, `remove_*`, `configure_*`, `setup_*` for imperative actions
- `verify_*` / `confirm_*` for post-action checks
- `mark_*` for counter/state bookkeeping side effects

Guidelines:

- Prefer concise names that communicate intent in 2-4 words.
- Avoid encoding implementation details in names unless needed for clarity.
- Keep related naming consistent across modules (for example, all package-manager predicates end in `_available`).
- If a helper only exists to support one flow, still name it as if it were a teammate-facing API.

Examples from this repo:

- `mark_command_installed`
- `remove_neofetch_via`
- `mark_1password_cli_installed`
- `print_tagged`

---

## ━━ Applications

### Alacritty

Install method depends on platform:

- macOS: installed from the latest GitHub release DMG
- Linux: installed via the system package manager (`apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman`)

### GitHub CLI (`gh`)

Installed via the active package manager:

- macOS: Homebrew
- Linux: `apt`, `dnf`, or `pacman`

If newly installed, the script may suggest:

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth setup-git
```

### GitHub Desktop

On macOS, installed from GitHub’s official distribution if not already present.

### 1Password

Install order:

1. Desktop app (if not present)
2. Safari extension reminder/check
3. CLI (`op`)

Notes:

- Desktop app uses its built-in auto-updater
- Script does **not** modify 1Password application settings
- Safari extension installation/enabling is prompted, not automated

### GPG

Installs:

```bash
gnupg
```

If GPG is installed but no secret keys are present, the script may suggest retrieving your key material from 1Password and importing it.

---

## ━━ macOS Configuration

macOS settings are applied only in interactive runs (not `--scheduled` / non-interactive contexts).

### Interactive-only preference

The only prompt-driven preference is one-time hostname setup.

Hostname prompting is cookie-controlled so it is not repeated on every run.

### Declarative defaults engine

Most macOS defaults are now applied through a reusable declarative engine that:

- reads the current value
- compares it to the desired state
- writes only when needed
- verifies after writing

This includes global defaults (for example appearance/accent, Safari, trackpad, and save/print panel preferences) plus Finder preferences.

### Finder

Finder preferences are applied through the same engine, including settings such as:

- List view by default
- path bar
- status bar
- tab bar
- showing all filename extensions
- Home as the default new-window target
- current-folder search scope
- folders on top
- hiding selected desktop items

Finder is restarted only if something actually changed and a restart is needed.

---

## ━━ Scheduling

The script can configure weekly maintenance runs.

- macOS → `launchd`
- Linux → `cron`

Runs weekly:

```text
Monday @ 00:00
```

Scheduling logic lives in its own module: `lib/scheduling.sh`.

---

## ━━ Design Philosophy

- **Never fail fast** → always continue as far as possible
- **Verify everything**
- **Readable output > clever output**
- **No hidden magic**
- **Respect existing system state**
- **Prefer official distribution methods when they are a better fit**
- **Refactor toward declarative patterns when it reduces repetition**

---

## ━━ Current Areas of Focus

Recent refactoring themes:

- a declarative task runner
- a declarative macOS defaults engine
- cleaner separation of concerns across `lib/`
- less duplicated imperative shell code
- more consistent validation and output

Refactoring is ongoing.
